# Adjusted-high_dimensional-GP-based-BO-methods
This repository contains implementations for REMBO, HeSBO, and BOCK adjusted to work with additional benchmark functions.

The code for REMBO and HeSBO is taken from https://github.com/aminnayebi/HesBO, and adjusted to include the Ackley, Griewank, Levy, Levy N.13, Schwefel, and 3-dimensional Hartmann Benchmark functions (https://www.sfu.ca/~ssurjano/optimization.html), and the Probability of Improvement acquisition function (https://distill.pub/2020/bayesian-optimization/).

The code for BOCK is taken from https://github.com/QUVA-Lab/HyperSphere, and adjusted to include the Ackley, Griewank, Levy N.13, and 3-dimensional Hartmann Benchmark functions (https://www.sfu.ca/~ssurjano/optimization.html), and the Probability of Improvement acquisition function (https://distill.pub/2020/bayesian-optimization/).
